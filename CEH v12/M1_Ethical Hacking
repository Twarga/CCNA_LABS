# Module 1 : Introduction to Ethical Hacking (Overview)
## Introduction to : 
- Ethical Hackers :
	- Hired by companies to perform penetration tests 
- Penetration test : 
	- Attempt to break into a company's network to find the weak links 
	
- Vulnerability assessment 
	- Test attempts to enumerate all vulnerabilities found in an application or on a system 

- Security test :
	- Tester analyzes a company's security policy and procedures. 
	- Reports any vulnerabilities to management. 
	

## The Role of Security and Penetration Testers
### Hackers 
Hackers access computer system or network 
- Without the authorization of the systems owner 
	- Considered as breaking the law; can go to prison 

### Crackers 
- Break into systems to steal or destroy data 
- THe U.S Department of Justice 
	- Labels all illegal access to a computer or network systems as hacking 
	
### Ethical Hacker 
- Performs most of the same activities a hacker does 
	- With the permission of the owner or company 
	
### Script Kiddies or packet monkeys 
- Derogatory terms to refer to younger , inexperienced people 
- They copy code or use tools createdd by knowledgeable programmers without understanding how they work 
- Programs or scripts used by experienced penetration testers 
	- To carry out attacks .
	- Python , Ruby , Perl or C
	- Script :
		- A set of intructions 
		- Runs in sequence to perform tasks on a computer system
		
### Hacktivist 
- A person who hacks cimputer systems for political or social reasons 
### Penetration testers 
- Usually have a laptop computer with multiple OSs and hacking tools 
- Job requirements for a penetration tester might include :
	- Perform vulnerability , attack, and penetration assessments 
		- In Internet, Internat and wireless envirnments 
	- Perform discovery and scanning 
		- For open ports and services 
	- Apply appropriate exploits 
		- To gain access and expand access as neccessary 

- Participate in activities 
	- Involving application penetration testing and application source code review 
- Interact with the client as required throught the engagement 
- Produce reports documenting discoveries durinf the engagement 
- Debrief with the client at the conclusion of each engagment 
- Participate in research and provide recommendations
	- For continuous improvement 
- Participate in knowledge sharing 
- Demonstrate a good understanding of current country, state, and city cyber laws.


## Penetration-Testing Methodologies 
### White box model 
- The tester is told what network topology and technology the company is using 
	- May be given a floor plan 
- Tester is permitted to interview IT personnel and company employees 
	- Makes the penetration tester's job easier 

### Black box model 
- Staff is not aware of the test 
- Tester is not given any diagras or details about the technologies used 
	- Burden is on the tester to find details using different techniques 
- Tests security personnel's ability to detect an attack. 

### Gray box model 
- Hyprid of th white and black box models 
- Company gives tester only partial information
	- Example : OSs are used , but not network diagrams 
	

## Certification Programs for Network Security Personnel 
- Certification programs 
	- Available in almost every area of network security 
- Minimum certification 
	- CompTIA Security+ certification or have equivalent knowledge 
		- Prequisite for Security+ certification is Comptia  Network+ level of knowlegde 
	
## CompTIA PenTest+ 
- Advance certification that verfies successful candidates have the knowledge and skills required to :
	- Plan and scope an assessment 
	- Understand legeal and compliance requirements 
	- Perform vulnerability scanning and penetration testing 
	- Analyze data 
	- Effectively report and communicate results 

## Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) 
- OSCP 
	- An advanced certification that requires students to demonstrate hands-on abilities to earn their certificates 
	- Covers network and application exploits 
	- Gives students experience in : 
		- Developing rudimentary buffer overflows 
		- Writing scripts to collect and manipulate data 
		- Trying exploits on vunerable systems 


## Certified Ethical Hacker 
- Developed by the international Council of Electronic COmmerce Consultants (EC-Council) 
	- The multiple-choice Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) exam is based on 22 domains the tester must be familiar with 
	- EC-Council website : https://www.eccouncil.org/
- Most likely to be placed on a team that conducts penetration tests 
	- Called a Red team 
		- Composed of people with varied skills who perform the tests 
		- Unlikely that one person will perform all tests 
		
## Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)
- CISSP 
	- Issued by the International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium (ISC^2)
	- Not geared toward technical IT professionals 
	- Tests security-related managerial skills 
		- Usually more concerned with policies and procedures 
	- Consists of questions from ten domains 
## SANS Institute 
- SysAdmin, Audit, Network , Security (SANS) Institute
	- Offres training and IT security certifications through Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC)

## Which Certification Is Best ? 
- Penetration testers and security testers 
	- Need technical skills to perform duties effectively
	- Must also have : 
		- A good understanding of networks and the role of management in an organization 
		- Skills in writing and verbal communication 
		- Desire to continue learning 
- Danger of certification exams :
	- Some participants simply memorize terminology 
		- Don't have a good grasp of subject matter or complex concepts
